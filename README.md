# Node.js-README-Challenge

DESCRIPTION
Creating a README using the command line is easy to do and creates a good learning experience for users.

HOW TO USE
In the terminal you can enter node index.js which will lead the user to a list of prompt questions. Once these questions are answered that are applicable, unanswered questions will not be shown in the README. Then a new README file should be generated!
